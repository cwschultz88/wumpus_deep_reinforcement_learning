# wumpus_deep_reinforcement_learning

This repo is set up to apply the principles of Deep Q Learning outlined in:
	
         Mnih, Volodymyr, et al. "Playing atari with deep reinforcement learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602 (2013).

to the Wumpus Game. The Wumpus game rules can be found in the textbook "Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach"


Best Results:
The average score for the agent was at 80 when program crashed. This is after learning from about 25k games directly

Future improvements:
  - Stream line wumpus game code - taking too long to play a game
  - Apply Convolutions to the network
  - Make the network Recurrent
